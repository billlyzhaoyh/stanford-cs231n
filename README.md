# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions


This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course offered by Stanford University which I followed along online(Spring 2019). All the solutions here are ungraded unfortunately because I am not enrolled as an official student

Find course notes and assignments [here](http://cs231n.github.io) and be sure to check out [Spring 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)!

Assignments using Tensorflow are completed, those using Pytorch will be implemented in the future.
